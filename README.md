## Current function

1. You can select a directory for saving pictures.
2. Input the keyword and click "search" button will show you how many works related to the keyword on Pixiv now.
3. You can download images with specified amounts!

## How to use

You will need `python` which version is equal or later than `version=3.5`, then use the command below:

On Windows 10 (cmd or powershell):

`python .\main.py`

On Linux:

`python3 main.py`

## TODO

1. Add "pause", "stop", "continue" function.
2. Add multi-thread process.
3. Add more comments for explaining the codes.
4. Rearrange the GUI make it looks more pretty. (It looks really awful right now I know)
5. Maybe rewrite `crawler.py` to make it looks tidy and neat.

Welcome any comment or issue for discussion.
